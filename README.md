# Wine_Quality_Classification_Project
Performance Evaluation and Optimization of Supervised Machine Learning Models for Wine Quality Classification\
# Project Outline Structure
1. Background / Introduction
Wine quality assessment is a crucial process in the wine industry, influencing both market value and consumer satisfaction. Traditional sensory evaluations are subjective and time-consuming. Machine learning offers a data-driven approach to predict wine quality efficiently. This study evaluates and optimizes supervised learning models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — to classify wine quality based on physicochemical properties.
2. Problem Statement
There is a need to identify the most effective supervised machine learning model for predicting wine quality with high accuracy and reliability. Despite numerous algorithms available, their comparative performance and optimal tuning for this dataset remain unclear.
3. Objectives
Main Objective:
To evaluate and optimize the performance of supervised machine learning models for wine quality classification.
Specific Objectives:
1.	To preprocess and explore the Wine Quality dataset.
2.	To train Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN classifiers.
3.	To optimize each model using hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV).
4.	To evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
5.	To identify the best-performing model for wine quality classification.
