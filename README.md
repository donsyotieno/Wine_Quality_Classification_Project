Performance Evaluation and Optimization of Supervised Machine Learning Models for Wine Quality Classification\
# Project Outline Structure
1. Background / Introduction
Wine quality assessment is a crucial process in the wine industry, influencing both market value and consumer satisfaction. Traditional sensory evaluations are subjective and time-consuming. Machine learning offers a data-driven approach to predict wine quality efficiently. This study evaluates and optimizes supervised learning models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — to classify wine quality based on physicochemical properties.
