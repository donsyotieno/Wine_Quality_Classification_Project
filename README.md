# Wine_Quality_Classification_Project
Performance Evaluation and Optimization of Supervised Machine Learning Models for Wine Quality Classification\
# Project Outline Structure
1. Background / Introduction
Briefly explain:
•	Why predicting wine quality matters (e.g., quality control, pricing, production efficiency).
•	The role of machine learning in improving accuracy and automation in quality assessment.
•	Motivation for comparing different models — performance trade-offs, interpretability, etc.
