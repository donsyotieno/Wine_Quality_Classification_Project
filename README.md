Performance Evaluation and Optimization of Supervised Machine Learning Models for Wine Quality Classification
**1. Introduction:**
Wine quality assessment is a crucial process in the wine industry, influencing both market value and consumer satisfaction. Traditional sensory evaluations are subjective and time-consuming. Machine learning provides a data-driven approach to efficiently predict wine quality. This study evaluates and optimizes supervised learning models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — to classify wine quality based on physicochemical properties.
**2. Problem Statement:**
There is a need to identify the most effective supervised machine learning model for predicting wine quality with high accuracy and reliability. Despite numerous algorithms available, their comparative performance and optimal tuning for this dataset remain unclear.
